                <h3>Beliefs</h3>
                <h4>The Scriptures</h4>
                <p>We believe that the Scriptures of the Old and New Testament are the revelation of God, infallible in their Divine inspiration, inerrant in the original manuscripts and therefore the final authority for all matters of faith and conduct.</p>
                <h4>God</h4>
                <p>We believe that God is the infinite and perfect Creator and that He eternally exists in three persons: Father, Son and Holy Spirit.</p>
                <h4>Man</h4>
                <p>We believe that man was created in the image of God; that he fell into sin; that the effects of sin touched all of his being; and that without Christ he is separated from God.</p>
                <h4>Jesus Christ</h4>
                <p>We believe that Jesus Christ is true God and true man, born of the virgin Mary through the work of the Holy Spirit; that he lived a sinless life and died in the place of sinners on the cross; that He physically rose from the dead and ascended into heaven; and that He one day will return to establish His kingdom and judge the world.</p>
