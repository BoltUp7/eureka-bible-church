        <h2 class="site-banner">What We Believe</h2>
        <div class="about-beliefs">
            <div>
                <h3>The Scriptures</h3>
                <p>We believe that the Scriptures of the Old and New Testament are the revelation of God, infallible in their Divine inspiration, inerrant in the original manuscripts and therefore the final authority for all matters of faith and conduct.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>God</h3>
                <p>We believe that God is the infinite and perfect Creator and that He eternally exists in three persons: Father, Son and Holy Spirit.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Man</h3>
                <p>We believe that man was created in the image of God; that he fell into sin; that the effects of sin touched all of his being; and that without Christ he is separated from God.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Jesus Christ</h3>
                <p>We believe that Jesus Christ is true God and true man, born of the virgin Mary through the work of the Holy Spirit; that he lived a sinless life and died in the place of sinners on the cross; that He physically rose from the dead and ascended into heaven; and that He one day will return to establish His kingdom and judge the world.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="about-beliefs">
            <div>
                <h3>Holy Spirit</h3>
                <p>We believe that the ministry of the Holy Spirit is to glorify Jesus Christ, convict sinners and regenerate the believer; that He indwells, guides and seals the believer; that He empowers the believer for righteous living; and that He equips the believer for service by giving spiritual gifts.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Salvation</h3>
                <p>We believe that salvation has been accomplished through the death of Jesus Christ on the cross and His resurrection to new life; that its basis is the grace of God alone; and that it is applied by the Holy Spirit to all who respond in faith to the gift of God.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Assurance</h3>
                <p>We believe that it is the privilege of all who are born again to be assured of their eternal salvation based on the finished work of Christ and the promises of God's Word.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="about-beliefs bottom-div">
            <div>
                <h3>The Church</h3>
                <p>We believe that all believers under the headship of Christ are part of the Church, the Body of Christ, and that the local church is made up of those believers who have joined together to bring glory to God through worship, fellowship, discipleship, and evangelism.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Christian Life</h3>
                <p>We believe that God has called His children to lead lives that are holy in a sinful world, with the Scriptures being the believer's guide in all things.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Christ's Return</h3>
                <p>We believe in the personal, visible, and imminent coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and that this promised hope has a vital influence on the personal life and motivation of the believer.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Man's Destiny</h3>
                <p>We believe in the bodily resurrection of the dead; of the believer to everlasting joy with the Lord; of the unbeliever to judgment and everlasting punishment.</p>
            </div>
